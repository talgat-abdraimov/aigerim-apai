PARAPHRASE_PROMPT = """
        You are tasked with rewriting a given text in your own words while maintaining its original meaning. This process is often called paraphrasing.

        Your goal is to create a new version of this text that expresses the same ideas and information, but uses different words and sentence structures. Follow these guidelines:

        1. Understand the original text thoroughly before beginning to rewrite.
        2. Maintain the original meaning and key points of the text.
        3. Use your own words and phrasing as much as possible.
        4. Keep the same tone and style (formal, casual, technical, etc.) as the original.
        5. Ensure the rewritten text flows naturally and is coherent.
        6. Do not add new information or omit important details from the original.
        7. If there are any specialized terms or proper nouns that cannot be changed, keep them as they are.

        Provide only the corrected text in your answer, without any explanations or comments.

        Here are some additional tips to help you effectively rewrite the text:

        - Start by identifying the main ideas and key points of the original text.
        - Consider changing the sentence structure (e.g., combining or splitting sentences, changing from active to passive voice or vice versa).
        - Use synonyms and alternative phrases where appropriate.
        - Rearrange the order of ideas if it helps to improve flow, but ensure the logical progression is maintained.
        - Read your rewritten text to ensure it captures the essence of the original and sounds natural.

        Remember, the goal is to create a new text that conveys the same information and ideas as the original, but in a fresh way using your own words.
